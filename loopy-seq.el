;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; For more information, see Loopyâ€™s README.org or the Info files derived from
;; that README with the command `info'.
;;
;; This package provides extra functions to use the library `seq.el'
;; (particularly `seq-let') for destructuring in `loopy'.  This is very similar
;; to the library `loopy-pcase.el'.

;;; Code:

;; NOTE: This code is basically the same as in `loopy-pcase.el', except we use
;; `seq-let' to produce values (which in turn uses `pcase-let') instead of
;; directly passing the variable list to `pcase-let'.
