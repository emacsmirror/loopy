;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; This package provides the "loop commands" used in the `loop' macro argument
;; of the `loopy' macro, as well as functions and variables for working with
;; those commands.
;;
;; For convenience, the functions related to destructuring in accumulation
;; commands are also included in this library, as those are specific to the
;; accumulation commands.
;;
;; For more information, see this package's Info documentation under Info node
;; `(loopy)'.

;;; Code:
;; Cant require `loopy', as that would be recursive.

(defcustom loopy-custom-command-parsers nil
  "An alist of pairs of a quoted command name and a parsing function.

The parsing function is chosen based on the command name (such as
`list' in `(list i my-list)'), not the usage of the command.  That is,

  (my-command var1)

and

  (my-command var1 var2)

are both parsed by the same function, but that parsing function
is not limited in how it responds to different usages.  If you
really want, it can return different instructions each time.
Learn more with `(info \"(emacs)loopy\")'.

For example, to add a `when' command (if one didn't already
exist), one could do

  (add-to-list \'loopy-custom-command-parsers
                (cons 'when #'my-loopy-parse-when-command))"
