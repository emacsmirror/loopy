~loopy~ is a macro meant for iterating and looping.  It is similar in usage to
~cl-loop~ ([[info:cl#Loop Facility]]) but uses symbolic expressions rather than
keywords.

For most use cases, ~loopy~ should a nice substitute for ~cl-loop~ and
complementary to the features provided by the =seq= ([[info:elisp#Sequence Functions]])
and =cl-lib= ([[info:cl]]) libraries and Emacs's regular looping and mapping features.

* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: A short overview.
  :END:

  The ~loopy~ macro is used to generate code for a loop, similar to ~cl-loop~.
  Unlike ~cl-loop~, ~loopy~ uses symbolic expressions instead of "clauses".

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; A simple usage of `cl-loop':
    (cl-loop for i from 1 to 10
             if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
             else collect i into odds
             end ; This `end' keyword is optional here.
             finally return (list odds evens))

    ;; How it could be done using `loopy':
    (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 10))
           (if (cl-evenp i)
               (collect evens i)
             (collect odds i))
           (finally-return odds evens))
  #+end_src

  ~loopy~ supports destructuring for iteration commands like =list= and
  accumulation commands like =sum= or =collect=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Summing the nth elements of arrays:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list (list-elem1 list-elem2)
                 '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                   ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum [sum1 sum2 sum3] list-elem1)
           (sum [sum4 sum5 sum6] list-elem2))

    ;; Or, more simply:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list list-elem '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                             ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum ([sum1 sum2 sum3] [sum4 sum5 sum6])
                list-elem))

    ;; Separate the elements of sub-list:
    ;; => ((1 3) (2 4))
    (loopy (list i '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect (elem1 elem2) i))
  #+end_src

  The ~loopy~ macro is configurable and extensible.  In addition to writing one's
  own "loop commands" (such as =list= in the example below), by using "flags",
  one can choose whether to instead use ~pcase-let~, ~seq-let~, or even the Dash
  library for destructuring.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Use Seq.el to destructure an array:
    ;; => ((1 4) ([2 3] [5 6]))
    (loopy (flag seq)
           (list elem '([1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
           (collect [i &rest j] elem))
  #+end_src

  Variables like =elem=, =i=, and =j= in the example above are automatically
  ~let~-bound so as to not affect code outside of the loop.

  ~loopy~ has arguments for binding (or not binding) variables, executing code
  before/after the loop, executing code only if the loop completes, and for
  setting the macro's return value (default ~nil~).  This is in addition to the
  looping features themselves.

  All of this makes ~loopy~ a useful and convenient choice for looping and
  iteration.

  That being said, Loopy is not yet feature complete.  Please request features
  or report problems in this project’s [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]].  While most cases are
  covered, full feature parity with some of the more niche uses of =cl-loop= is
  still being worked on.

* Basic Concepts
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: basic-concepts
  :DESCRIPTION: Basic information about `loopy' and its loops.
  :END:

  Except for an optional loop name, all arguments of the ~loopy~ macro are
  symbolic expressions that create a loop, assigns variables in the lexical
  environment that surrounds the loop, adds code that runs before/after the
  loop, and sets the ultimate return value of the macro.

  For convenience and clarity, symbolic expressions that generate code in the
  loop body are called "loop commands" ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).  Symbolic
  expressions that generate code around the loop are called "special macro
  arguments" or just "macro arguments" as opposed to "loop commands"
  ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]).

  "Loop commands" are the main feature of the ~loopy~ macro, such as the =list=
  in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  A command inserts code into the loop body, but can
  also perform additional setup like initializing variables.  Many commands set
  a condition for ending the loop.

  The loop ends when any condition required by a loop command evaluates to
  false.  If no conditions are needed, the loop runs infinitely until a =return=
  or =return-from= command is reached ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Exiting the Loop Early]]).

  Except when using accumulating loop commands ([[#accumulation-commands][Accumulation Commands]]), return
  values must be stated explicitly, either as an early return in the loop body
  via the =return= or =return-from= commands, or as part of the =finally-return=
  macro argument.  =nil= is returned by default.

  The macro is configurable.  One can add custom commands ([[#adding-custom-commands][Custom Commands]]), add
  custom command aliases ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]), and specify macro options for a
  particular loop ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).  Each of these ideas is explained in detail
  later in this document.

* Special Macro Arguments
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: macro-arguments
  :DESCRIPTION: Creating the environment of the loop.
  :END:

  #+cindex: special macro argument
  There are 7 special macro arguments. One, an unquoted symbol, is taken as the
  loop's name. The others, listed below, are symbolic expressions that begin
  with a keyword or one of their aliases. You do not need to use all of them.

  If a macro argument does not match one of these special 7, ~loopy~ will
  attempt to interpret it as a loop command, and throw an error if that fails.

  These special macro arguments are always processed before loop commands,
  regardless of the order of the arguments passed to ~loopy~.  As they are not
  loop commands, they cannot occur in sub-loops ([[*Sub-loops][Sub-loops]]).

  #+findex: with, let*
  - =with=, =let*=, =init= :: Declare variables before the loop.  This can also
    be used to initialize variables referenced by loop commands.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

             ...)

      (loopy (initially (message "1: initially loop")
                        (message "2: initially loop"))
             ...)
    #+end_src

  #+findex: after-do, after, else-do, else
  - =after-do=, =after=, =else-do=, =else= :: Run Lisp expressions after the

             (finally-do (message "This always messaged.")))

      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
             (when (cl-oddp i) (break))

  #+findex: finally-return
  - =finally-return= :: Return a value, regardless of how the loop completes.
    Accumulation commands have an implicit return value, but this argument
    overrides them.  Specifying multiple return values is the same as returning
    a list of those values.  This is convenient when used with ~seq-let~,
    ~pcase-let~, ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and the like.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
             (when (cl-oddp i)
               (return "This return value is over-ridden."))
             (finally-return "This string always returned."))

      ;; => (1 2 3)
      (loopy (repeat 0)
             (finally-return 1 2 3))
    #+end_src

  #+findex: flag, flags
  - =flag=, =flags= :: Options that change the behavior of ~loopy~
    ([[*Changing the Macro's Behavior with Flags][Changing the Macro's Behavior with Flags]]).

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (flag dash)
             (list (whole &as a b) '((1 2) (3 4)))
             ...)

      (loopy (flags dash)
             (list (whole &as a b) '((1 2) (3 4)))
             ...)
    #+end_src


  As stated above, all other expressions will be considered loop commands
  ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).


  #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For convenience, the ~while~-loop that ~loopy~ creates is wrapped by a
  ~cl-block~.  Naming the loop names this block, which is created /after/
  initializing variables.

  The two special macro arguments =before-do= and =after-do= (and their aliases)
  also occur within this ~cl-block~, before and after the loop, respectively.
  This has 2 consequences:

  1. Using ~cl-return~ in =before-do= will prevent the both loop and =after-do=
     code from running.

  2. Using ~cl-return~ or an early exit command ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Early Exit]]) in the loop will
     prevent the =after-do= code from running.  For this reason, =after-do= is
     run if and only if the loop completes successfully, hence the alias
     =else-do= and the similarity to Python's ~else~ statement for loops.

  These three sections (=before-do=, =after-do=, and the ~while~-loop itself)
  are the only structures that occur within the ~cl-block~.  Using ~cl-return~
  in =before-do=, for example, will not stop code in =finally-do= from running
  or values listed in =finally-return= from being returned.
  #+END_QUOTE

* Loop Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: loop-commands
  :DESCRIPTION: The main features of `loopy'.
  :END:

  #+cindex: loop command
  If a macro argument does not match one of the previously listed special macro
  arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]), ~loopy~ will attempt to treat it as a
  loop command.  Loop commands are only valid as a top-level argument to the
  macro, or inside another loop command.

  Therefore, these macro calls are valid:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect coll i)
           ;; Special macro argument:
           (finally-return coll))

    ;; Implicit accumulation variable and implicit return value:
    (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect i))
  #+END_SRC

  and this is not:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (with (list i '(1 2 3)))
           (finally-return (collect coll i)))
  #+END_SRC

  Trying to use loop commands where they don't belong will result in errors
  when the code is evaluated.

  You should keep in mind that commands are evaluated in order.  This means that
  attempting to do something like the below example might not do what you
  expect, as =i= is assigned a value from the list after collecting =i= into
  =coll=.

  #+caption: An example of how loop commands are evaluated in order.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; => (nil 1 2)
    (loopy (collect coll i)
           (list i '(1 2 3))
           (finally-return coll))
  #+END_SRC

  For convenience and understanding, the same command might have multiple names,
  called {{{dfn(aliases)}}}.  For example, the command =expr= has an alias
  =set=, because =expr= is used to set a variable to the value of an expression.
  You can add custom aliases using the function ~loopy-defalias~, which modifies
  the user option ~loopy-custom-command-aliases~ ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]).

  Some commands take optional arguments.  For example, the command =list= can
  take a function as an optional argument, which affects how that iterates
  through the elements in the list.

  For simplicity, the commands are described using the following notation:

  - If a command has multiple names, the names are separated by a vertical
    bar, such as in =expr|set=.
  - =VAR= is an unquoted symbol that will be used as a variable name, such as
    =i= in =(list i my-list)=.
  - =FUNC= is a Lisp function name, such as =my-func=, =#'my-func= or
    ='my-func=.
  - =NAME= is an unquoted name of a loop (or, more accurately, of a
    =cl-block=).
  - =EXPR= is a single Lisp expression, such as =(+ 1 2)=, ='(1 2 3)=,
    =my-var=, or =(some-function my-var)=.  =EXPRS= means multiple expressions.
    Really, we are concerned with the value of the expression, not the
    expression itself.
  - =CMD= is a loop command, as opposed to a normal Lisp expression.
    =(list i '(1 2 3))=, =(repeat 5)=, and =(return-from outer-loop 7)=
    are examples of loop commands.  =CMDS= means multiple commands.
  - Optional arguments are surround by brackets.  =[EXPR]= is an optional
    expression, and =[CMD]= is an optional command.  By extension,
    =[EXPRS]= is equivalent to =[EXPR [EXPR [...]]]=, and =[CMDS]= to
    =[CMD [CMD [...]]]=.
  - Optional keyword arguments are shown as =&key key1 key2 ...=, where =key1=,
    =key2=, and so on are the literal keywords.  Just like in functions,
    keywords must be prefixed by a colon (":").  For example, the iteration
    command =nums= has a keyword argument =by=, which can be given a value using
    =:by SOME-EXPRESSION=.


  Generally, =VAR= is initialized to ~nil~, but not always.  This document
  tries to note when that is not the case.

  #+cindex: variable destructuring
  For convenience, =VAR= can be a sequence, either a list or a vector (as a
  stand-in for an array), of symbols instead of a single symbol.  This tells
  the command to “de-structure” the value of =EXPR=, similar to the functions
  ~seq-let~, ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and ~pcase-let~.  This sequence of
  symbols can be shorter than the destructured sequence, /but not longer/.  If
  shorter, the unassigned elements of the list are simply ignored.  To assign
  the final ~cdr~ of a destructured list, use dotted notation.

  #+caption: Several examples of destructuring.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => [(9 10 11 4) (9 10 11 8)]
    (loopy (with (my-array [(1 2 3 4) (5 6 7 8)]))
           (array-ref (i j k) my-array)
           ;; NOTE: The remaining elements are ignored.
           (do (setf i 9)
               (setf j 10)
               (setf k 11))
           (finally-return my-array))

    ;; => ([9 10 11 4] [9 10 11 8])
    (loopy (with (my-list '([1 2 3 4 ] [5 6 7 8])))
           (list-ref [i j k] my-list)
           ;; NOTE: The remaining elements are ignored.
           (do (setf i 9)
               (setf j 10)
               (setf k 11))
           (finally-return my-list))

    ;; => (1 (2 3))
    (loopy (list (i . j) '((1 2 3)))
           (finally-return i j))

    ;; => ((1 22))
    (loopy (with (my-list '((1 2 3))))
           (list-ref (_ . j) my-list)
           (do (setf j '(22)))
           (finally-return my-list))

    ;; => [(1 22)]
    (loopy (with (my-array [(1 2 3)]))
           (array-ref (_ . j) my-array)
           (do (setf j '(22)))
           (finally-return my-array))
  #+end_src

  Most commands that assign variables (even the =-ref= commands, which use
  ~setf~-able places instead of actual variables) can use destructuring, but
  not all kinds of destructuring make sense in all situations.

     If =INIT= is provided, use that as the initial value of =VAR=.  This could
     also be achieved by specifying a value using the =with= special macro
     argument.  When destructuring, each variable is initialized to =INIT=, not
     a destructured part of =INIT=.

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
     #+begin_quote
     =expr= does /not/ behave the same as ~setq~ in all situations.

     While =expr= can take multiple arguments, it only assigns the value of one
     expression to one variable during each iteration of the loop (unless using
     destructuring).  It cannot take pairs of variables and values in the same
     way that ~setq~ does.

     Furthermore, variables assigned by =expr= (and other commands) are by
     default ~let~-bound around the loop and generally initialized to ~nil~.
     This means that doing =(expr VAR EXPR)= will not, by default, affect
     variables outside of the loop in the same way that using =(do (setq VAR
     EXPR))= would.

** Iteration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: iteration-and-looping-commands
   :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through sequences, etc.
   :END:

   Iteration commands bind local variables and determine when the loop ends.
   If no command sets that condition, then the loop runs forever.

   Iteration commands must occur in the top level of the ~loopy~ form or in a
   =sub-loop= command.  Trying to do something like the below will signal an
   error.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
            (when (cl-evenp i)

   The =-ref= (as in “reference”) commands create ~setf~-able places instead of
   true variables.  Like other commands, they too can use destructuring, in
   which case the variables in the sequence =VAR= are also ~setf~-able places
   instead of true variables.

   #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
   #+begin_quote
   In ~loopy~, iteration commands are named after what they iterate through.
   For example, =array= and =list= iterate through the elements of arrays and
   lists, respectively.  For the convenience of familiarity, these commands also
   have aliases based on their equivalent =for=-clause from ~cl-loop~.

   To translate =for VAR in LIST= from ~cl-loop~ to ~loopy~, one can use either
   =(list VAR LIST)= or =(in VAR LIST)=.  This can be helpful when using
   ~loopy-iter~ ([[#loopy-iter][The ~loopy-iter~ Macro]]), in which case you could write any of
   =(for list VAR LIST)=, =(for in VAR LIST)=, or =(in VAR LIST)=, depending on
   whether you have enabled the =lax-naming= flag.

     the second element is the value.  For vectors, the key is the index.  You
     should not rely on the order in which the key-value pairs are found.

     These pairs are created before the loop begins.  In other words, the map
     =EXPR= is not processed progressively, but all at once.  Therefore, this
     command can have a noticeable start-up cost when working with very large
     maps.

** Accumulation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: accumulation-commands
   :DESCRIPTION: Accumulating values into new sequences, aggregating values, etc.
   :END:

   Accumulation commands are used to accumulate or aggregate values into a
   variable.  For example, creating a list of values or summing the elements in
   a sequence can both be done using accumulation commands.

   If needed, you can refer to the same accumulation variable in multiple
   accumulation commands, such as in the following example.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect coll i)
            (collect coll (+ i 5))
            (finally-return coll)) ; => (1 6 2 7 3 8)
   #+end_src

   #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
   #+begin_quote
   Like with other loop commands, variables created by accumulation commands
   (such as =coll= in the above example) are initialized to ~nil~ unless
   stated otherwise.
   #+end_quote

   #+cindex: accumulation destructuring
   Like iteration loop commands, accumulation commands can also use
   destructuring, in which case the destructured values are accumulated instead
   of the "whole" value.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect (coll1 coll2 coll3) elem)
            (finally-return coll1 coll2 coll3))

     ;; => (5 7 9)
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (sum (sum1 sum2 sum3) elem)
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))

     ;; Returns the same values as above.
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (expr sum1 (cl-first elem)  (+ sum1 (cl-first elem)))
            (expr sum2 (cl-second elem) (+ sum2 (cl-second elem)))
            (expr sum3 (cl-third elem)  (+ sum3 (cl-third elem)))
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))
   #+end_src

   #+cindex: implied/implicit return values
   Using an accumulation command implies a return value for the macro, which you
   can override using the =return= and =return-from= loop commands or the
   =finally-return= macro argument.  If there are multiple accumulation
   variables (including those created via destructuring), then the implied
   return value of the macro is a list of those accumulated values in the order
   that their respective command occurs in the loop body.  In the example below,
   note that ~my-collection~ is the first element in the list of values returned
   by the macro, even though the collection happens /after/ the first summation.
   This is because the macro sees the =collect= command before it sees the =sum=
   command.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (((4 5 6)) 5 7 9), for (`my-collection', `sum1', `sum2', `sum3')
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (when (equal elem '(4 5 6))
              (collect my-collection elem))
            (sum (my-sum1 my-sum2 my-sum3) elem))
   #+end_src

   #+cindex: implied/implicit accumulation results
   #+vindex: loopy-result
   Like in ~cl-loop~, you do not need to supply a variable name to accumulation
   commands.  If no accumulation variable is given, accumulation commands will
   use the variable ~loopy-result~.  This variable is accessible in the
   =after-do=, =finally-do=, and =finally-return= special macro arguments.  As a
   consequence of how the macro expands, changing the value of ~loopy-result~ in
   the =after-do= (but not =finally-do=) macro argument changes the implied
   return value of the loop.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (cl-assert (equal (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (after-do (cl-return loopy-result)))

                       (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (finally-return loopy-result))))

     ;; => (0 1 2 3)
     (cl-assert (equal (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (else-do (push 0 loopy-result)
                                       (cl-return loopy-result)))
                       (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (finally-do (push 0 loopy-result))
                              (finally-return loopy-result))))
   #+end_src

   Like in ~cl-loop~, all accumulation commands using implied variables will
   accumulate into the same implied variable (that is, into ~loopy-result~).
   You should make sure that such commands are compatible.  For example, you
   should not try to accumulate =collect= results and =sum= results into
   ~loopy-result~, as trying to use a list as a number will cause an error.  If
   you want to collect into separate variables, just specify a variable name
   like you normally would.

   #+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
   #+begin_quote
   You should not try to access implied accumulation results (e.g.,
   ~loopy-result~) while the loop is running.  Implied results are only required
   to be correct after the loop ends (before code in =else-do= is run), allowing
   for more efficient code.

   Furthermore, because using a =return= or =return-from= command overrides
   implied return values, using these commands can prevent implied accumulation
   results from being finalized.  Using the =leave= command, which exits the
   loop without returning a value, does not affect the correctness of implied
   results.
   #+end_quote

   You should prefer using accumulation with implied results whenever you don't
   need to access the accumulation results during the loop.  Because ~loopy~ has
   more freedom when generating implied accumulation results, using implied
   results can be much faster.

   As noted above, ~loopy~ will by default accumulate into the same implied
   variable, ~loopy-result~.  If you wish to have the speed of implied results
   while accumulating into separate variables, you should enable the =split=
   flag ([[#flags][Flags]]).  This flag will make the macro split the implied
   results of each accumulation command into a separate variable instead of
   using ~loopy-result~.  This can be much faster than using destructuring with
   accumulation commands.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Both of these example give the same result, but the latter can
     ;; expand into more efficient code.

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))

            (collect (i j k) elem))

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (flag split) ; Don't implicitly accumulate into `loopy-result'.
            (list (i j k) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect i)        ; Without the `split' flag,
            (collect j)        ; this would just produce
            (collect k))       ; (1 2 3 4 5 6).
   #+end_src

   #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
   #+begin_quote
   You will notice that each accumulation command has an alias of the command
   name in the present participle form (the "-ing" form).

   For example, instead of "min" or "minimize", you can use "minning" or
   "minimizing".  Instead of "sum" and "append", you can use "summing" and
   "appending".  This helps to avoid name collisions when using the ~loopy-iter~
   macro with the =lax-naming= flag enabled ([[#loopy-iter][The ~loopy-iter~ Macro]]).
   #+end_quote

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword arguments
   Some accumulation commands have optional keyword parameters, which are listed
   in the command's definition.  To avoid repetition, the common parameters are
   all described below.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword at
   - =at= :: Where to place a value.  One of =end=, =start=, or =beginning=
     (equivalent to =start=).  If ungiven, defaults to =end=.  These positions
     need not be quoted.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword into
   - =into= :: An alternative way to specify the variable into which to
     accumulate values.  One would normally just give =VAR= as the first
     argument of the loop command, but if you wish, you can use this keyword
     argument for a more ~cl-loop~-like syntax.

     As all accumulation commands support this keyword, it is not listed in
     any command definition.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword test
   - =test= :: A function of two arguments, usually used to test for equality.
     Most tests default to ~eql~, as in Common Lisp and the =cl-lib= library.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword key
   - =key= :: A function of one argument, used to transform the inputs of
     =test=.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword init
   - =init= :: The initial value of =VAR=.  For explicitly named variables, one
     can use this argument or the =with= special macro argument.  When using the
     =split= flag, this argument is the only way to specify a non-default
     initial value.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword result-type
   - =result-type= :: A sequence type into which =VAR= is converted /after the
     loop is over/.  These types need not be quoted.  For example, ='vector= and
     =vector= are both valid ways to specify the data type vector.

     This argument can be more convenient than writing out a call to ~cl-coerce~
     or ~seq-into~.

   The arguments to the =test= and =key= parameters can be quoted functions or
   variables, just like when using ~cl-union~, ~cl-adjoin~, and so on.  ~loopy~
   knows how to expand efficiently for either case.

   The available accumulation commands are:

   - =(accumulate VAR EXPR FUNC &key init)= :: Accumulate the result of applying
     function =FUNC= to =EXPR= and =VAR=.  =EXPR= and =VAR= are used as the
     first and second arguments to =FUNC=, respectively.

** Boolean
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: boolean-commands

   :END:

   Boolean commands are used to test whether a condition holds true for elements
   of a sequence.  Under certain conditions, they cause the loop to exit and
   return a value.  Like accumulation commands, they have an implicit return
   value which is used if these commands do not cause the loop to exit.

   It is incorrect to use both =thereis= and one of =always= or =never= in the
   same loop, as this leads to conflicting implicit return values.

   For convenience, these commands can be passed multiple conditions.

   #+findex: always
   - =(always COND [CONDS])= :: Immediately return ~nil~ if any =COND= is ever
     ~nil~.  Otherwise, the loop returns the final value of the last =COND= or

** Sub-loops
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Running a loop within a loop.
   :END:

   #+findex: sub-loop, subloop, loop
   - =(sub-loop|subloop|loop [CMDS])= :: Create a sub-loop in the same lexical
     environment as the top-level loop.


   There are two main ways to have a sub-loop in ~loopy~:

   1. Use another ~loopy~ call in a =do= command.
   2. Use the =sub-loop= (aliases =loop= and =subloop=) command.

   =sub-loop= is better for accumulating into variables, as is does not create
   its own result variable (unlike calling ~loopy~ again).  When using the
   =sub-loop= command, keep in mind the following:

   1. Only loop commands are valid within a sub-loop, not special macro
      arguments like =with= or =finally-return=.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; GOOD:
        ;; => (8 9 10)
        (loopy (with (a 7))
               (repeat 1)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect (+ a i))))

        ;; BAD:
        (loopy (repeat 1)
               (loop (with (a 7))
                     (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect (+ a i))))
      #+end_src

   2. Sub-loops can be named, but they do not have their own return value. The
      default loop name in ~loopy~ is ~nil~ for the top-level loop, but not for
      sub-loops.  To return from the outer loop, you can use =return-from=.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; Return from inner1 so never reach 4.
        ;; => ((3 5) (3 5))
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop inner1
                     (list j '(3 4))
                     (loop (list k '(5 6 7))
                           (if (= k 6)
                               (return-from inner1)
                             (collect (list j k))))))

        ;; Can use `return-from' on `nil' to refer to the
        ;; top-level loop, if un-named. Otherwise use the name.
        (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
               (loop (list j '(5 4 3))
                     (if (= i j)
                         (return-from nil i)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))
      #+end_src

      Because there is no return value for sub-loops, the =return= and =leave=
      commands behave similarly.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => ((1 .6) (2 . 6))
        (loopy (list i '(1 2))
               (loop (list j '(6 7 8))
                     (if (= j 7)
                         (return)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))

        ;; => ((1 .6) (2 . 6))
        (loopy (list i '(1 2))
               (loop (list j '(6 7 8))
                     (if (= j 7)
                         (leave)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))
      #+end_src

   3. Variables used for iteration can be local to a sub-loop, but not
      variables used for accumulation.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; GOOD:
        ;; => (0 1 2 3 1 2 3)
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect my-coll i))
               (finally-return (cons 0 my-coll)))

        ;; BAD:
        ;; Would not give (0 3 3).  Instead, signals error.
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3)))
               ;; Error:  `i' doesn't exist outside the sub-loop:
               (collect my-coll i)
               (finally-return (cons 0 my-coll)))

* The ~loopy-iter~ Macro
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: loopy-iter
  :DESCRIPTION: Embedding loop commands in arbitrary code.
  :END:

  #+cindex: loopy-iter
  #+findex: loopy-iter
  ~loopy-iter~ is a macro that allows for the embedding of loop commands inside
  arbitrary code, instead of trying to use the =do= loop command to embed
  arbitrary code in a loop.  You must use ~require~ to load this feature.

  #+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
  #+begin_quote
  *This feature is still experimental.*  It might not work correctly in all
  circumstances.
  #+end_quote

  This macro is meant to be conceptually similar to the ~iterate~ or ~iter~
  macro provided by the Common Lisp package "Iterate" [fn:iter] (not to be
  confused with the ~iter-*~ functions provided by Emacs).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'loopy-iter) ; <- Must `require' to load feature.

    ;; => (2 4 6)
    (loopy-iter (for list i '(1 2 3))
                (let ((a (* 2 i)))
                  (accum collect a)))
  #+end_src

  #+cindex: loopy-iter keywords
  #+vindex: loopy-iter-command-keywords
  To clearly distinguish between loop commands and Emacs features (such as the
  loop command =list= and the function ~list~), a loop command must be preceded
  by one of the keywords =for=, =accum=, or =exit=.  These keywords do not share
  a name with any built-in Emacs feature and are similar to the keywords used by
  other packages.

  Any keyword in the user option ~loopy-iter-command-keywords~ can be used to
  identify any loop command.  For example, =(accum collect a)= and
  =(for collect a)= are both valid ways of referring to the =collect= loop
  command in ~loopy-iter~.

  To disable this requirement, use the flag =lax-naming= ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).  When
  using =lax-naming=, ~loopy-iter~ will always prefer built-in features to loop
  commands.  E.g., "list" will always be understood as referring to the function
  ~list~ and not the loop command =list=.

  #+vindex: loopy-iter-ignored-commands
  If for some reason you wish for ~loopy-iter~ to ignore a loop command while
  using =lax-naming=, you can add that symbol to ~loopy-iter-ignored-commands~.

  Special macro arguments, already having clearly distinguishable names, do not
  need to be preceded by one of the above keywords.  However, some aliases (such
  as =let*= for =with=) will not work in ~loopy-iter~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 8) (2 9) (3 10))
    (loopy-iter (with (a 7))                ; <- Set once around loop.
                (for list elem '(1 2 3))
                (let* ((c elem)             ; <- These set inside of loop.
                       (d (+ a c)))
                  (accum collect (list c d))))
  #+end_src

  Restrictions on the placement of loop commands and special macro arguments
  still apply in ~loopy-iter~.  For example, iteration commands must still occur
  at the top level of ~loopy-iter~ or a sub-loop.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; BAD
    (loopy-iter (let ((a (progn
                           ;; ERROR: `list' must occur at top level.
                           (for list j '(8 9 10 11 12))
                           j)))
                  (accum collect a)))

    ;; GOOD
    ;; => (8 9 10 11 12)
    (loopy-iter (let ((a (progn
                           ;; NOTE: No restriction on placement of `expr'.
                           (for expr j 8 (1+ j))
                           (when (> j 12)
                             ;; Leave loop but don't force return value,
                             ;; allowing implicit result to be returned.
                             (exit leave))
                           j)))
                  (accum collect a)))
  #+end_src

  You should not rely on the values of the code into which loop commands
  translate.  For example, the above usage of =expr= might become a ~setq~ form,
  but that is an implementation detail and subject to change.  Best practice is
  to instead use a variable as the last expression in a ~progn~ form.

  For convenience, ~loopy-iter~ will not attempt to interpret loop commands in
  quoted code, except in sharp-quoted ~lambda~ forms.  This is because the
  ~lambda~ macro is self-quoting, and so Emacs might quote the form before it is
  seen by ~loopy-iter~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (1 2 3)
    (loopy-iter (for list elem '(1 2 3))
                (funcall (lambda (x)
                           (accum collect x))
                         elem))

    ;; => (1 2 3)
    (loopy-iter (for list elem '(1 2 3))
                (funcall #'(lambda (x) ; <- sharp-quoted, but still interpreted
                             (accum collect x))
                         elem))
  #+end_src

  #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
  #+begin_quote
  Nesting arbitrary code in the loop requires knowing how to understand the
  code.  You might find cases where ~loopy-iter~ interprets code incorrectly.

  Please report such cases on this project's [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]].
  #+end_quote

  ~loopy~ (and so ~loopy-iter~) does not currently have all of the features of
  Common Lisp's ~iter~ macro.  Think of it more as a way to use loop commands
  embedded in arbitrary code.


* Using Flags
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: flags
  :DESCRIPTION: Using flags to change behavior.
  :END:

  #+cindex: flag
  A "flag" is a symbol passed to the =flag= or =flags= macro argument, and
  changes the macro's behavior.  Currently, flags affect what ~loopy~ uses to
  perform destructuring (~pcase-let~, ~seq-let~, =dash=, or the default method)
  and whether accumulation commands that don't specify a variable (such as
  =(collect collect-value)=) accumulate into one or several variables.

  Flags are applied in order, so if you specify =(flags seq pcase)= ~loopy~ will
  use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring, not ~seq-let~.

  #+vindex: loopy-default-flags
  If you wish to always use a flag, you can add that flag to the list
  ~loopy-default-flags~.  These can be overridden by any flag given in the
  =flag= macro argument.

  The following flags are currently supported:

  #+cindex: pcase flag
  - =pcase= :: Use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring
    ([[info:elisp#Destructuring with pcase Patterns]]).
  #+cindex: seq flag
  - =seq= :: Use ~seq-let~ for destructuring ([[info:elisp#seq-let]]).
  #+cindex: dash flag
  - =dash= :: Use the style of destructuring found in the =dash= library
   ([[info:dash#-let]]).
  #+cindex: split flag
  - =split= :: Make accumulation commands with implicit variables accumulate into
    separate variables instead of into ~loopy-result~.
  #+cindex: lax-naming flag
  - =lax-naming= :: In ~loopy-iter~, don't require keywords when using loop
    commands ([[#loopy-iter][The ~loopy-iter~ Macro]]).
  #+cindex: default flag
  - =default= :: Use the default behavior for all options.


  For convenience, all flags (except =default=) can be undone by prefixing them
  with =-= (a dash or minus sign), which reverts ~loopy~ to its default
  behavior.

  For example, if you have set ~loopy-default-flags~ to =(dash split)= and wish
  to only use the =split= flag for a loop, you can use either =(flags default
  split)= or, more simply, =(flag -dash)=.  These prefixed flags only apply when
  the unprefixed version is active.  That is, =(flags pcase -dash)= is the same
  as just =(flags pcase)=, regardless of the value of ~loopy-default-flags~, as
  =pcase= destructuring will override all uses of =dash= destructuring as it
  comes later in the list.  Similarly, =(flags -dash dash)= and =(flags -dash
  +dash)= leave =dash= destructuring enabled, and =(flags +dash -dash)= disables
  =dash= destructuring and uses the default behavior.

  #+cindex: loopy-dash
  #+cindex: loopy-pcase
  #+cindex: loopy-seq
  The destructuring flags (=pcase=, =seq=, and =dash=) are separate libraries
  (respectively, =loopy-pcase=, =loopy-seq=, and =loopy-dash=) that must be
  loaded after =loopy=.  Currently, =loopy-dash= is a separate package.

  Below are some example of using the destructuring flags.  These flags do not
  affect the destructuring of commands using generalized variables (i.e.,
  ~setf~-able places).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))) ; whole
    ;;     (1 4)                 ; i
    ;;     (2 5)                 ; j
    ;;     (3 6))                ; k
    (require 'loopy-dash)
    (loopy (flag dash)
           (list elem '((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))))
           (collect (whole &as i (j k)) elem))

    ;; => ((1 4) (3 6))
    (require 'loopy-pcase)
    (loopy (flag pcase)
           (list elem '((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))))
           (collect `(,a (,_ ,b)) elem))

    ;; => ((1 6) (3 8) ([4 5] [9 10]))
    (require 'loopy-seq)
    (loopy (flag seq)
           (list elem '([1 2 3 4 5] [6 7 8 9 10]))
           (collect [a _ b &rest c] elem))
  #+end_src

  The =split= flag can be more efficient than using destructuring with
  accumulation commands.  Some accumulation commands can have more efficient
  behavior when using implicit accumulation variables, since the variables can't
  be accessed until the loop ends.  Using the =split= flag allows you to do this
  easily for multiple variables.

  This can make a noticeable difference on large lists, but note that if you use
  this feature, you will not be able to access the implicit return values with
  loopy-result.  They will each have their own, uniquely generated name in
  each loop.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Both of these example give the same result, but the latter
     ;; can expand into more efficient code.
     ;;
     ;; There is also the `push-into' command, which avoids this problem when
     ;; used with `nreverse'.

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))

* Custom Aliases
  :PROPERTIES:

  :DESCRIPTION: How to add one's own aliases.
  :END:

  #+cindex: custom aliases
  An {{{dfn(alias)}}} is another name for a command.  ~loopy~ comes with several
  built-in aliases, such as =set= for the command =expr=.

  #+vindex: loopy-custom-command-aliases
  #+findex: loopy-defalias
  Custom aliases can be added to the user option ~loopy-custom-command-aliases~.
  Each element in this list is a pair of the alias and the definition.  For
  convenience, the function ~loopy-defalias~ is provided, which will correctly
  add the pairs to this variable.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; You don't need to quote either of the arguments,
    ;; but you can if you prefer.
    (loopy-defalias l list)
    (loopy-defalias a 'array)

    ;; => ((1 . 4) (2 . 5) (3 . 6))
    (loopy (l i '(1 2 3))
           (a j [4 5 6])
           (collect (cons i j)))

    ;; => ((a . array) (l . list))
    loopy-custom-command-aliases
  #+end_src

  #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
  #+begin_quote
  The macro checks for command definitions in the following order:

  1. Custom aliases
  2. Custom commands
  3. Built-in commands


  If an alias is found, the macro will check first whether it is an alias of a
  custom command, then whether it is an alias of a built-in command.
  #+end_quote

  The special macro arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]) can also be aliased.
  Using an alias does not change that the special arguments are parsed before
  ~loopy~ attempts to parse loop commands.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (loopy-defalias as with)

    ;; => (8 9 10)
    (loopy (as (a 7))

* Custom Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: adding-custom-commands
  :DESCRIPTION: Extending `loopy' with personal commands.
  :END:

  This section contains information about how loop commands work and how one can
  add custom commands to ~loopy~.  Two examples are provided.

** Background Info
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background-info
   :DESCRIPTION: The internals of `loopy'.
   :END:

   #+cindex: instruction, instructions
   The core working of =loopy= is taking a command and generating code that is
   substituted into or around a loop body.  This code is transmitted between
   functions as {{{dfn(instructions)}}}, which describe how the code is to be
   used.

   Some examples of instructions are:
   - Declaring a given variable in a let form to make sure it's locally
     scoped.
   - Declaring a generated variable in a let form to contain a given value.
   - Adding a condition for continuing/exiting the loop.
   - Adding code to be run during the main loop body.
   - Adding code to be run after the main loop body.

   For example, parsing the command =(list i '(1 2 3))= produces the following
   list of instructions.  Some commands require the creation of unique temporary
   variables, such as =list-3717= in the below output.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ((loopy--iteration-vars list-3717 '(1 2 3))
      (loopy--latter-body setq list-3717 (cdr list-3717))
      (loopy--pre-conditions consp list-3717)
      (loopy--main-body setq i (car list-3717))
      (loopy--iteration-vars i nil))
   #+END_SRC

   The ~car~ of an instruction is the place to put code and the ~cdr~ of the
   instruction is said code to put.  You can see that not all of the code to be
   inserted is a valid Lisp form.  Instead of being evaluated as an expression,
   some instructions insert pairs of names and values into variable lists like
   in ~let~ and ~let*~ .

   | Place                   | Code                               |
   |-------------------------+------------------------------------|
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(list-3717 '(1 2 3))=             |
   | =loopy--latter-body=    | =(setq list-3717 (cdr list-3717))= |
   | =loopy--pre-conditions= | =(consp list-3717)=                |
   | =loopy--main-body=      | =(setq i (car list-3717))=         |
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(i nil)=                          |

   Commands are parsed by =loopy--parse-loop-commands=, which receives a list of
   commands and returns a list of instructions.  For commands that take
   sub-commands as arguments (such as =cond=, =if=, and =when=), more specific
   parsing functions are called in a mutually recursive fashion (e.g.,
   Function-1 uses Function-2 which uses Function-1, and so on).

   For example, consider the function =loopy--parse-if-command=, which parses
   the =if= command.  It needs to be able to group any code going to the loop
   body under an ~if~-form.  To do this, it uses =loopy--parse-loop-command= to
   turn its sub-commands into a list of instructions, and then checks the =car=
   of each instruction to whether the code should be inserted into the loop's
   main body (and so whether it should be wrapped in the ~if~-form).

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (cl-defun loopy--parse-if-command
         ((_ condition &optional if-true &rest if-false))
       "Parse the `if' loop command.  This takes the entire command.

     - CONDITION is a Lisp expression.
     - IF-TRUE is the first sub-command of the `if' command.
     - IF-FALSE are all the other sub-commands."
       (let (full-instructions
             if-true-main-body
             if-false-main-body)
         (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-command if-true))
           (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
               (push (cdr instruction) if-true-main-body)
             (push instruction full-instructions)))
         (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-commands if-false))
           (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
               (push (cdr instruction) if-false-main-body)
             (push instruction full-instructions)))
         ;; Push the actual main-body instruction.
         (setq if-true-main-body
               (if (= 1 (length if-true-main-body))
                   (car if-true-main-body)
                 (cons 'progn (nreverse if-true-main-body))))

         ;; Return the list of instructions.
         (cons `(loopy--main-body
                 . (if ,condition
                       ,if-true-main-body
                     ,@(nreverse if-false-main-body)))
               (nreverse full-instructions))))
   #+END_SRC

   The hardest part of this exchange is making sure the inserted code ends up in
   the correct order.

   A loop body command has 7 main places to put code:

   #+vindex: loopy--generalized-vars
   - =loopy--generalized-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and a macro
     expansion that will be given to =cl-symbol-macrolet=.  This is used to
     create named ~setf~-able places.  The expansion you use depends on the kind
     of sequence and how the it is updated.

     For example, =(list-ref i my-list)= declares =i= to be a symbol which
     expands to =(car TEMP-VAR)=, in which =TEMP-VAR= holds the value of
     =my-list=.  At the end of the loop body, =TEMP-VAR= is set to its =cdr=,
     ensuring that the next call to =car= returns the correct value.

   #+vindex: loopy--iteration-vars
   - =loopy--iteration-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will be
     given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     iteration commands, such as the =i= in =(list i '(1 2 3))= or to store the
     list ='(1 2 3)= in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  This also includes variables
     needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--accumulation-vars
   - =loopy--accumulation-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will
     be given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     accumulation commands, such as the =coll= in =(collect coll my-val)= or any
     variables needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--pre-conditions
   - =loopy--pre-conditions= :: Expressions that determine if the =while=
     loop runs/continues, such as whether a list still has elements in it.
     If there is more than one expression, than all expressions are used in
     an =and= special form.

   #+vindex: loopy--main-body
   - =loopy--main-body= :: Expressions that make up the main body of the
     loop.

   #+vindex: loopy--latter-body
   - =loopy--latter-body= :: Expressions that need to be run after the main
     body, such as updating some of variables that determine when a loop ends.

   #+vindex: loopy--post-conditions
   - =loopy--post-conditions= :: Expressions that determine whether the
     =while= loop continues, but checked after the loop body has run.  The
     code from this is ultimately appended to the latter body before being
     substituted in.

   For accumulation commands, you might also wish to place values in the
   following:

   #+vindex: loopy--implicit-return
   - =loopy--implicit-return= :: A list of values to be returned by the loop if
     no other return value is specified/reached.  All accumulation commands can
     add a value to this list, which can include the variable ~loopy-result~ if
     an accumulation command is used without specifying a variable.

     For example, =(collect my-collection my-value)= would add =my-collection=
     to this list.

   #+vindex: loopy--implicit-accumulation-final-update
   - =loopy--implicit-accumulation-final-update= :: Actions to perform on
     ~loopy-result~ after the loop ends.  Some implied accumulation commands
     need to update the variable one final time after ending the loop, such as
     making sure it is in the right order.  Although this variable is a list of
     such updates, to avoid conflicts, only the update at the head of the list
     is performed.

   There are 4 more variables a loop command can push to, but they are derived
   from the macro's arguments.  Adding to them after using a macro argument
   might lead to unintended behavior.  You might wish to use them if, for
   example, you are concerned with what happens after the loop exits/completes.

   #+vindex: loopy--before-do
   - =loopy--before-do= :: Expressions to evaluate before the loop.  These are
     derived from the =before-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--after-do
   - =loopy--after-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes
     successfully.  These are derived from the =after-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-do
   - =loopy--final-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes,
     regardless of success.  These are derived from the =finally-do= macro
     argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-return
   - =loopy--final-return= :: An expression that is always returned by the
     macro, regardless of any early returns in the loop body.  This is
     derived from the =finally-return= macro argument.


   #+vindex: loopy--loop-name
   Some commands might depend on the name of the loop.  The symbol which names
   the loop is stored in the variable ~loopy--loop-name~.  The default value is
   ~nil~ for normal loop and uniquely generated for sub-loops created with the
   =sub-loop= command.

   The structure of the macro’s expanded code depends on the features used
   (e.g., =loopy= won’t try to declare variables if none exist), but the result
   will work similar to the below example.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     `(cl-symbol-macrolet ,loopy--generalized-vars
        (let* ,loopy--with-vars
          (let ,loopy--accumulation-vars

              (let ((loopy--early-return-capture
                     (cl-block ,loopy--name-arg
                       ,@loopy--before-do
                       (while ,(cl-case (length loopy--pre-conditions)
                                 (0 t)
                                 (1 (car loopy--pre-conditions))
                                 (t (cons 'and loopy--pre-conditions)))
                         (cl-tagbody
                          ,@loopy--main-body
                          loopy--continue-tag
                          ,@loopy--latter-body))
                       ,@loopy--after-do
                       nil)))
                ,@loopy--final-do
                ,(if loopy--final-return
                     loopy--final-return
                   'loopy--early-return-capture))))))
   #+END_SRC

** Hello World
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-small-example
   :DESCRIPTION: A minimal working example.
   :END:

   To implement a custom loop body command, =loopy= needs two pieces of
   information:
   1. The keyword that names your command
   2. The parsing function that can turn uses of your command into instructions.

   Importantly, your custom commands cannot share a name.

   For example, say that you're tired of typing out
   =(do (message "Hello, %s" first last))= and would prefer to instead use
   =(greet FIRST [LAST])=.  This only requires pushing code into the main
   loopy body, so the definition of the parsing function is quite simple.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (cl-defun my-loopy-greet-command-parser ((_ first &optional last))
       "Greet one with first name FIRST and optional last name LAST."
       `((loopy--main-body . (if ,last
                                 (message "Hello, %s %s" ,first ,last)
                               (message "Hello, %s" ,first)))))
   #+END_SRC

   =loopy= will pass the entire command expression to the parsing function, and
   expects back a list of instructions.

   #+vindex: loopy-custom-command-parsers
   To tell =loopy= about this function, add it and the command name =greet= to
   the variable =loopy-custom-command-parsers=.  When ~loopy~ doesn’t recognize
   a command, it will search in this alist for a matching symbol.  The function
   that is paired with the symbol receives the entire command expressions, and
   should produce a list of valid instructions.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'loopy-custom-command-parsers
                  '(greet . my-loopy-greet-command-parser))
   #+END_SRC

   After that, you can use your custom command in the loop body.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list name '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
            (greet (car name) (cadr name)))
   #+END_SRC

   By running =M-x pp-macroexpand-last-sexp= on the above expression, you can
   see that it expands to do what we want, as expected.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (let ((g815 '(("John" "Deer")
                   ("Jane" "Doe")
                   ("Jimmy")))
           (name nil))
       (while (consp g815)
         (setq name (car g815))
         (if (cadr name)
             (message "Hello, %s %s"
                      (car name) (cadr name))
           (message "Hello, %s" (car name)))
         (setq g815 (cdr g815)))
       nil)
   #+END_SRC

** An ~always~ Command
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: always-example
   :DESCRIPTION: Adding a feature from `cl-loop'.
   :END:

   Lets say we want to emulate ~cl-loop~'s =always= clause, which causes the
   loop to return =nil= if an expression evaluates to =nil= and =t= otherwise.
   This is similar to the functions ~cl-every~ and ~seq-every-p~.

   Here is an example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; => t
     (cl-loop for i in (number-sequence 1 9) always (< i 10))
   #+END_SRC

   Actually, =loopy= already has an =always= command, but for the sake of this
   example let's assume that it doesn't.  Without a custom command, you could
   translate this using the following code:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; => t
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
            (when (< i 10) (return nil))
            (else-do (cl-return t)))
   #+END_SRC

   This is similar to what you might write in other languages, such as Python.

   #+begin_src python
     # In some testing Python function:
     for i in range(1, 10):
         if i < 10:
             return False
     else:
         return True
   #+end_src

   While the meaning of the code is clear, this approach is certainly wordier.

   Here's how one could do this using a custom command.  Again, =loopy= already
   comes with a built-in =always= command.  This example is taken directly from
   the file {{{file(loopy-commands.el)}}}, which contains the code of all of
   ~loopy~'s built-in parsers.

   We can describe the command's desired behavior in two sentences:
   1. The loop should immediately return ~nil~ if the expression ever evaluates
      to ~nil~.
   2. The loop should return ~t~ if the loop is able to complete successfully.


   This simplest way to satisfy the first requirement is to conditionally use
   ~cl-return~ if the expressions ever evaluates to ~nil~.  We want to do this
   while the loop is running, so we should use an instruction for
   ~loopy--main-body~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; We want to insert the below code into the loop
     (when CONDITION
       (cl-return nil))

     ;; so we use the instruction
     `(loopy--main-body . (when ,CONDITION (cl-return nil)))

     ;; where CONDITION is supplied by the parsing function.
   #+end_src

   For a simple loop, this works well enough.  However, the function ~cl-return~
   only works with blocks that are named ~nil~.  If we have named the loop, then
   ~cl-return~ won't work, and might instead cause unexpected errors.
   Therefore, it is better to use ~cl-return-from~ with the variable
   ~loopy--loop-name~.  As noted in the previous section, ~loopy--loop-name~
   stores the symbol which names the loop.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     `(loopy--main-body
       . (when ,CONDITION (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))
   #+end_src

   The best way to satisfy the second requirement is to use an instruction for
   ~loopy--implicit-return~.  One /could/ try to insert code using
   ~cl-return-from~ into ~loopy--after-do~, and this /would/ cause a value to be
   returned after the loop had successfully completed, but doing it that way
   could unexpectedly prevent other code in =after-do= from running.  Using an
   implicit return value does not have that problem.

   This gives us the following instruction, which will add ~t~ to the list of
   values the macro returns if nothing else would be returned.  If that list is
   just ~'(t)~, then the macro knows to just return ~t~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     '(loopy--implicit-return . t)
   #+end_src

   Once we've chosen our instructions, we need to tell =loopy= what function to
   use to produce these instructions.  Like in the previous example, we define
   are parsing function and add it to the alist ~loopy-custom-command-parsers~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; As noted in the previous section, the parsing function is always
     ;; passed the entire command as `(always CONDTION)', not just the
     ;; command arguments as `CONDITION'.

     (cl-defun my--loopy-always-command-parser ((_ condition))
       "Parse a command of the form `(always CONDITION)'.

     If any condition is nil, `loopy' should immediately return nil.
     Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."
       `((loopy--implicit-return . t)
         (loopy--main-body . (unless condition
                               (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))))

     (add-to-list 'loopy-custom-command-parsers
                  (cons 'always #'my--loopy-always-command-parser))
   #+end_src

   Once we've added our parsing function to ~loopy-custom-command-parsers~,
   =loopy= will use that function whenever it tries to understand the =always=
   command.  In this case, this custom parser would supercede the built-in
   parser.

   With that done, our custom =always= command is as useful as the corresponding
   ~cl-loop~ clause.  However, because ~loopy~ uses expressions instead of
   keyword clauses like ~cl-loop~, we can do slightly better.  For convenience,
   we can easily allow passing multiple conditions to the command instead of
   just one.  In such cases, the conditions should be wrapped in an ~and~ form,
   and that is indeed what the built-in parser does.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; The built-in parser, taken from `loopy-commands.el':
     (cl-defun loopy--parse-always-command ((_ &rest conditions))
       "Parse a command of the form `(always [CONDITIONS])'.

     ;; The previous example is equivalent to this.

* Comparing to ~cl-loop~
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: comparing-to-cl-loop
  :DESCRIPTION: Why `loopy' instead of `cl-loop'.
  :END:

  =loopy= should be comparable with =cl-loop= for most things, keeping in
  mind the following:
  - It is probably less efficient than =cl-loop=, though I am so far trying to
    keep the same logic that =cl-loop= uses.
  - It has more flexible control-flow commands, under which you can easily group
    sub-commands, including assignments.
  - It has a =skip= command to skip the rest of the loop body and immediately
    start the next iteration.  Of course, a similar effect could be achieved
    using the =when= or =unless= commands.

  =loopy= is not always one-to-one replacement for =cl-loop=, but it is easy to
  use and extend, and performs well in the cases that it already handles.

  Below is a simple example of =loopy= vs =cl-loop=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl-lib)
    (cl-loop with some-thing = 5
             for i from 1 to 100
             do (message "I is %s" i)
             when (> (+ i 5) 20)
             return (format "Done: %d" i))

    (require 'loopy)
    (loopy (with (some-thing 5))
           (list i (number-sequence 1 100))
           (do (message "I is %s" i))
           (when (> (+ i 5) 20)
             (return (format "Done: %d" i))))
  #+END_SRC

  The main benefit (I believe) of Loopy is clearer grouping of commands under
  conditionals while still using a clean syntax, such as in the below example.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; => '((2 4) (4 8) (6 12) (8 16) (10 20))
    (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 10))
           (when (cl-evenp i)
             (expr once i)
             (expr twice (* 2 i))
             (collect together (list once twice)))
           (finally-return together))
  #+END_SRC

  In my experience, =cl-loop= does not allow the easy grouping of assignment
  statements under a =when= condition.  For example, below is something I would
  like to try to do with =cl-loop=.

  I am aware that in this example the =for= statements aren't necessary and that
  the =collect= statements would be sufficient, but (when I come across things
  like this in my work) I would like to use them to declare variables for
  readability purposes.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl-lib)
    (save-match-data
      (cl-loop with pattern = "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"
               for line in (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2")
               when (string-match pattern line)
               for line-num = (concat "L" (match-string 1 line))
               and for data-num = (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))

               ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

               and collect line-num into line-nums
               and collect data-num into data-nums
               finally return (list line-nums data-nums)))

    ;; Normal Elisp:
    (save-match-data
      (let ((pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)")
            (line-nums)
            (data-nums))
        (dolist (line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
          (when (string-match pattern line)
            (let ((line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
                  (datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))))

              ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

              (push line-num line-nums)
              (push datum-num data-nums))))
        (list (nreverse line-nums) (nreverse data-nums))))
  #+END_SRC

  Here is how one could currently do it with =loopy=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'loopy)
    (save-match-data
      (loopy (with (pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"))
             (list line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
             (when (string-match pattern line)
               (expr line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
               (expr datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line)))

               ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

               (collect line-nums line-num)
               (collect data-nums datum-num))
             (finally-return line-nums data-nums)))
  #+END_SRC

  I believe that the value of the macro increases for longer loop bodies with
  several conditional commands.

  Another nice ability, one that I'm not sure =cl-loop= has, is a specific
  command for skipping/continuing a loop iteration.  Of course, one could also
  re-organize code under a conditional command like =when= to achieve the same
  effect.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Returns even numbers that aren't multiples of 10.
    (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 20))
           (when (zerop (mod i 10))
             (skip))
           (when (cl-evenp i)
             (push-into my-collection i))
           (finally-return (nreverse my-collection))) ; => (2 4 6 8 12 14 16 18)
  #+END_SRC

* Translating =cl-loop=
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: translating-from-cl-loop
  :DESCRIPTION: Converting `cl-loop' to `loopy', and vice versa.
  :END:

  ~loopy~ and ~cl-loop~ use slightly different terminology.  The equivalent of
  "for clauses" are referred to as "iteration commands" in ~loopy~, as they
  generally are used for iterating through sequences.  Meanwhile, "iteration
  clauses" can be separated into "iteration commands" (=repeat= and =iter-by=
  (not yet implemented)) and "early-exit commands" (=while= and =until=).

  "Accumulation clauses" work the same as "accumulation commands".

** For Clauses
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: for-clauses
   :END:

   As Emacs has many functions that return lists, there is no need to implement
   an exact equivalent for every =for=-clause that =cl-loop= has.  Instead, one
   can just iterate through the return value of the appropriate function using
   the =list= command.

*  Real-World Examples
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Extra example of how one could use `loopy'.
  :END:

  This section contains examples of loops that exist in real-world commands.  To
  see these loops in context, full examples of those commands can be found in
  the file [[file:loopy-examples.el]] (containing the library =loopy-examples=) that
  comes with this package.

  One command that could see a benefit from using =loopy= is =selectrum-swiper=
  from the Selectrum wiki [fn:sel-wiki].  This command allows a user to jump to
  a matched line in the buffer.  Candidates are created by looping through text
  lines, formatting non-empty lines and collecting the formatted lines into a
  list of candidates.  At the same time, it selects a default candidate by
  finding the non-empty line closest to the current line.

  Here is the main portion of the command, which uses =cl-loop=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (cl-loop
     with buffer-lines = (split-string (buffer-string) "\n")
     with number-format = (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string
                                   (length (number-to-string
                                            (length buffer-lines))))
                                  "d: ")

     with formatted-candidates = nil
     for line-text in buffer-lines
     for line-num = (line-number-at-pos (point-min) t) then (1+ line-num)

     with default-candidate = nil
     with prev-distance-to-default-cand = 1.0e+INF ; This updated later.
     for distance-to-default-cand = (abs (- current-line-number line-num))

     unless (string-empty-p line-text)      ; Just skip empty lines.
     do
     ;; Find if we’ve started to move away from the current line.
     (when (null default-candidate)
       (when (> distance-to-default-cand
                prev-distance-to-default-cand)
         (setq default-candidate (cl-first formatted-candidates)))
       (setq prev-distance-to-default-cand distance-to-default-cand))

     ;; Format current line and collect candidate.
     (push (propertize line-text
                       'selectrum-candidate-display-prefix
                       (propertize (format number-format line-num)
                                   'face 'completions-annotations)
                       'line-num line-num)
           formatted-candidates)

     finally return (list default-candidate
                          (nreverse formatted-candidates)))
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

  The limitations of =cl-loop='s =when= clause encourages relying on Lisp
  expressions rather than clauses for processing.  To use those Lisp
  expressions, one must declare more variables with the =with= clause to ensure
  that those variables are locally scoped.

  Here is how it could be done with =loopy=:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (loopy
     (with (buffer-text-lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))
           (number-format (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string
                                   (length (number-to-string
                                            (length buffer-text-lines))))
                                  "d: ")))
     (list line-text buffer-text-lines)
     (expr line-num (line-number-at-pos (point-min) t)
           (1+ line-num))
     (unless (string-empty-p line-text)
       (push-into formatted-candidates
                  (propertize line-text
                              'selectrum-candidate-display-prefix
                              (propertize (format number-format line-num)
                                          'face 'completions-annotations)
                              'line-num line-num))
       ;; There are a few different ways that you could express
       ;; this.
       (when (null default-candidate)
         (expr prev-dist +1.0e+INF dist-to-default-cand)
         (expr dist-to-default-cand (abs (- current-line-number
                                            line-num)))
         (when (> dist-to-default-cand prev-dist)
           (expr default-candidate (cl-second formatted-candidates)))))
     (finally-return default-candidate (nreverse formatted-candidates)))
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

  We can see that most of the loop commands are easily grouped under the
  =unless= command.  This allows for less noise, as we do not need to declare
  variables or fall back to using more Lisp expressions.

  Another good example is the command =selectrum-outline= from the same page.
  This command is similar to =selectrum-swiper=, but has a slightly more
  complicated processing portion.

  The code loops through each line in the buffer, searching for lines that match
  a pre-determined regular expression.  The match data is used to determine the
  heading level (top level, second level, etc.) and the actual heading text.
  The loop produces formatted candidates by prepending this heading text with
  the text of parent headings, as determined by the heading level.  At the same
  time, the loop selects the current heading as the default candidate.

  Instead of using =cl-loop=, this command is written in conventional Emacs
  Lisp.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (let (;; Get the basic information of each heading in the accessible
          ;; portion of the buffer.
          (buffer-lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))
          (line-number 0)
          (line-number-format)

          ;; Finding the default heading
          (default-heading)
          (current-line-number (line-number-at-pos (point)))

          ;; Keeping track of the tree.
          (backwards-prefix-list)
          (prev-heading-text)
          (prev-heading-level)

          ;; Backwards result of the ‘dolist'. Will ‘nreverse’.
          (formatted-headings))

      (setq line-number-format
            (concat "L%0"
                    (number-to-string
                     (length (number-to-string (length buffer-lines))))
                    "d: "))

      (save-match-data
        (dolist (text-line buffer-lines)
          ;; Increment line number when moving to next.

  In my opinion, the =loopy= version is a bit cleaner.  Even when following the
  same flow of logic, you still get the benefit of less typing with no loss in
  clarity.

  If one were writing code like this often (say, in a library), then the loop
  body could be simplified even further with custom commands
  ([[#adding-custom-commands]]).
