;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; The `loopy' macro has several possible arguments, each beginning with a
;; keyword.
;;
;; - `with' declares variables that are bound in order before and around the
;; loop, like in a `let*' binding.
;; - `without' declares variables that ~loopy~ should not try to initialize.
;; - `before-do' is a list of normal Lisp expressions to run before the loop
;; executes.
;; - `loop' is a list of special commands that create the loop body.  These
;; commands are described in detail in this package's Info document.
;; - `after-do' is a list of normal Lisp expressions to run after the successful
;; completion of the loop.
;; - `finally-do' is a list of normal Lisp expressions that always run,
;; regardless of whether an early return was triggered in the loop body.
;; - `finally-return' is an expression whose value is always returned, regardless
;; of whether an early return was triggered in the loop body.
;; - `flags' is a list of symbols that change the macro's behavior.
;;
;; The loop commands generally follow the form `(COMMAND VARIABLE-NAME &rest ARGS)'.
;; For example,
;;
;; - To iterate through a sequence, use `(seq elem [1 2 3])' (for
;;   efficiency, there are also more specific commands, like `list').
;; - To collect values into a list, use `(collect my-collection collected-value)'.
;; - To just bind a variable to the result of a Lisp expression, use
;;   `(expr my-var (my-func))'
;;
;; Below is a full example of the arguments of the `loopy' macro.  The top-level
;; forms have a flexible-order, but meaning is clearest if they have the
;; following order.  All of the arguments are technically optional, but having a
;; loop without a body wouldn't be useful.
;;
;; For more information, see this package's Info documentation under Info node
;; `(loopy)'.

;;;;; Variables that can be set by flags
(defvar loopy--split-implied-accumulation-results nil

Nil means that each accumulation command without a named
accumulation variable should accumulate into the same variable,
by default named `loopy-result'.")

The function named by this variable is used to produce lists of
undotted variable-value pairs, suitable for substituting into a
`let*' form or being combined under a `setq' form.

The function is used for destructuring in iteration loop
commands (like `list' or `array') and for destructuring the
variables given in the `with' macro argument.

Th function is not used for accumulation commands, since those
commands have their own kind of destructuring.  For that, see the
variable `loopy--destructuring-accumulation-parser'.

If nil, use `loopy--destructure-variables-default'.")

(defvar loopy--destructuring-accumulation-parser nil
  "The function used to parse destructuring accumulation commands.

Accumulation commands are generally incompatible with the
destructuring produced by the function named by the variable
`loopy--basic-destructuring-function'.  Instead, parsers for
destructuring accumulation commands are able to produce
instructions however they see fit.

Unlike `loopy--basic-destructuring-function', the function named
by this variable returns instructions, not a list of
variable-value pairs.

If nil, use `loopy--parse-destructuring-accumulation-command'.")

`loopy' tries to initialize all variables that it uses in a

This list includes variables explicitly named in a command (such
as the `collection' in `(collect collection value)') and variables
required for destructuring in accumulation commands.

Unlike in `loopy--iteration-vars', these variables should be
accessible from anywhere in the macro, and should not be reset

These expressions are created by parsing the loop commands passed to `loopy'.

For example, the command (list i my-list) effectively puts
\(setq i (pop my-list)) into the loop body.  Most commands require some setup,
and so don't affect only the loop body.")

(defvar loopy--latter-body nil
  "A list of expressions to run after the main loop body.
These expressions are created by parsing the loop commands passed to `loopy'.

For example, updating an indexing variable should only happen
after the variable is used.")

(defvar loopy--post-conditions nil
  "Post-conditions that could cause the loop to exit evaluating the loop body.

All expressions in the list must be true for the program to continue.
This is similar to `do-while' in other languages.")

(defvar loopy--implicit-return nil
  "The implicit return value of loops that use accumulation commands.")

(defvar loopy-result nil
  "The result of using implicit accumulation commands in `loopy'.

All accumulation commands with no given variable (such
as `(collect my-val)') will accumulate into `loopy-result'.

While `loopy-result' is an implied return value, it need not be
the only implied value, and can still be returned in a list with
other implied return values, if any.")

;;;;; Variables for constructing the code

;; These variable affect how the code is expanded.
(defvar loopy--skip-used nil
  "Whether a skip/continue command is present in the loop main body.")

(defvar loopy--tagbody-exit-used nil

This has the effect of leaving the loop without immediately
returning a value.")

(defvar loopy--implicit-accumulation-final-update nil
  "Actions to perform on the implicit accumulation variable.

So as to avoid conflicts, there can be only one final action.
This variable is a list of such actions, but only the action at
the head of the list will be performed.

For example, it is usually more efficient to build a list in
reverse order, so a final update might be to reverse a backwards
list so that it is in the correct order.")

(defvar loopy--implicit-accumulation-updated nil
  "Whether the implicit accumulation commands were finally updated.

If a `cl-tagbody' exit is used (such by a `while' or `until'
command, which don't return values, just leaving the loop), then
the `after-do' body is skipped.  This also has the consequence of
skipping the final update to implicit accumulation variables,
which needs to run before the `after-do' body so that the
variable is safe when accessed.

To work around this, the final update before the `after-do' will
set this variable to t if it has run.  This value will be
checked after the tag-body exit if `loopy--tagbody-exit-used' is
t.")

;;;; The Macro Itself
;;;###autoload
(cl-defmacro loopy (&rest body)
  "A looping macro.

The macro takes several top-level arguments, all, except a loop
name, being a list beginning with one of the keywords below.  To
name a loop, pass in an unquoted symbol as an argument.

- `with', `let*': Declare variables before the loop.

- `without', `no-init': Variables that `loopy' should not try to
  initialize.  `loopy' tries to initialize all the variables it
  uses in a `let'-like form, but that isn’t always desired.

- `before-do', `before': Run Lisp expressions before the loop
  starts.

- `loop' (or no keyword): Add expressions to the loop body,
  perform any setup like initializing variables or adding exit
  conditions.  This is done using \"loop commands\", which are
  described in this packages Info document.

- `after-do', `after', `else-do', `else': Run Lisp expressions
  after the loop successfully completes.  This is similar to
  Python’s `else' loop clause.

- `finally-do', `finally': Always run Lisp expressions after the
  loop exits.

- `finally-return', `return': Return a value, regardless of how
  the loop completes.  Accumulation commands have an implicit
  return value, but this overrides them.

- `flag', `flags': Options that change the behavior of `loopy'.

The loop body and any expressions that are part of the
`before-do' and `after-do' arguments are contained in a single
`cl-block'.  Naming the loop really just names the block,
allowing for more specific exiting via ~cl-return~ and the loop
commands that wrap it.

Finally, `(finally-return 1 2 3)' is the same as
`(finally-return (list 1 2 3))'.  This is convenient when using
`seq-let', `pcase-let', `cl-destructuring-bind', and the like.

For more information, including a list of available loop commands,
see the Info node `(loopy)' distributed with this package."
