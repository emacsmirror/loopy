;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; There are several special macro arguments:
;;
;;   - `with' declares variables that are bound in order before and around the
;;     loop, like in a `let*' binding.
;;
;;   - `without' declares variables that ~loopy~ should not try to initialize.
;;
;;   - `before-do' is a list of normal Lisp expressions to run before the loop
;;     executes.
;;
;;   - `after-do' is a list of normal Lisp expressions to run after the successful
;;     completion of the loop.
;;
;;   - `finally-do' is a list of normal Lisp expressions that always run,
;;     regardless of whether an early return was triggered in the loop body.
;;
;;   - `finally-return' is an expression whose value is always returned, regardless
;;     of whether an early return was triggered in the loop body.
;;
;;   - `flags' is a list of symbols that change the macro's behavior.
;;
;; Additionally, a symbol can be used to name the loop.
;;
;; Any argument that doesn't match the above is taken to be a loop command.  The
;; loop commands generally follow the form `(COMMAND VARIABLE-NAME &rest ARGS)'.
;; For example,
;;
;; - To iterate through a sequence, use `(seq elem [1 2 3])' (for
;;   efficiency, there are also more specific commands, like `list').
;; - To collect values into a list, use `(collect my-collection collected-value)'.
;; - To just bind a variable to the result of a Lisp expression, use
;;   `(expr my-var (my-func))'
;;
;; For more information, including the full list of loop commands and how to
;; extend the macro, see this package's Info documentation under Info node
;; `(loopy)'.

   the expanded macro code.

The function named by this variable receives a sequence of

variables which must be initialized in the loop.

Generally, the main-body expression should use `setq' to assign
to the variables found in the sequence of variable names, and the
list of variables to initialize will include the variables in
said sequence and any others that might leek through.

If nil, use `loopy--destructure-for-iteration-default'.")

used, as well as how the bindings are expanded into the loop's
surrounding code, is determined by the destructuring system being
used.

They are created by passing (with (VAR1 VAL1) (VAR2 VAL2) ...) to
`loopy'.")

(defvar loopy--without-vars nil
  "A list of variables that `loopy' won't try to initialize.

`loopy' tries to initialize all variables that it uses in a

destructuring in iteration commands, and other variables required

  `while' to start/loop.")

(defvar loopy--main-body nil
  "A list of expressions to run (in order) inside the loop.
These expressions are created by parsing the loop commands passed to `loopy'.

For example, the command (list i my-list) effectively puts
\(setq i (pop my-list)) into the loop body.  Most commands require some setup,
and so don't affect only the loop body.")

(defvar loopy--latter-body nil
  "A list of expressions to run after the main loop body.
These expressions are created by parsing the loop commands passed to `loopy'.

For example, updating an indexing variable should only happen
after the variable is used.")

All accumulation commands with no given variable (such
as `(collect my-val)') will accumulate into `loopy-result'.

While `loopy-result' is an implied return value, it need not be
the only implied value, and can still be returned in a list with
other implied return values, if any.")

;;;;; Variables for constructing the code
(defvar loopy--in-sub-level nil
  "Whether the commands parsed are not in the top level of a loop.

Certain commands (e.g., `list' or `array') can only occur in the
top level of a loop.  Sub-loops (those created by the `sub-loop'
command) create for themselves a new, local top level.")

;; These variable affect how the code is expanded.
(defvar loopy--skip-used nil
  "Whether a skip/continue command is present in the loop main body.")

(defvar loopy--tagbody-exit-used nil
  "Whether a command uses a tag-body to jump to the end of the `cl-block'.

This has the effect of leaving the loop without immediately
returning a value.")

(defvar loopy--implicit-accumulation-final-update nil
  "Actions to perform on the implicit accumulation variable.

So as to avoid conflicts, there can be only one final action.
This variable is a list of such actions, but only the action at
the head of the list will be performed.

For example, it is usually more efficient to build a list in
reverse order, so a final update might be to reverse a backwards
list so that it is in the correct order.")

(defvar loopy--implicit-accumulation-updated nil
  "Whether the implicit accumulation commands were finally updated.

If a `cl-tagbody' exit is used (such by a `while' or `until'
command, which don't return values, just leaving the loop), then
the `after-do' body is skipped.  This also has the consequence of
skipping the final update to implicit accumulation variables,
which needs to run before the `after-do' body so that the
variable is safe when accessed.

To work around this, the final update before the `after-do' will
set this variable to t if it has run.  This value will be
checked after the tag-body exit if `loopy--tagbody-exit-used' is
t.")

(cl-defmacro loopy (&rest body)
  "A looping macro.

The macro takes several top-level arguments, all, except a loop
name, being a list beginning with one of the keywords below.  To
name a loop, pass in an unquoted symbol as an argument.

- `with', `let*': Declare variables before the loop.

- `without', `no-init': Variables that `loopy' should not try to
  initialize.  `loopy' tries to initialize all the variables it
  uses in a `let'-like form, but that isn’t always desired.

- `before-do', `before', `initially-do', `initially': Run Lisp
  expressions before the loop starts.

- `after-do', `after', `else-do', `else': Run Lisp expressions
  after the loop successfully completes.  This is similar to
  Python’s `else' loop clause.

- `finally-do', `finally': Always run Lisp expressions after the
  loop exits.

- `finally-return', `return': Return a value, regardless of how
  the loop completes.  Accumulation commands have an implicit
  return value, but this overrides them.

- `flag', `flags': Options that change the behavior of `loopy'.

The loop body and any expressions that are part of the
`before-do' and `after-do' arguments are contained in a single
`cl-block'.  Naming the loop really just names the block,
allowing for more specific exiting via ~cl-return~ and the loop
commands that wrap it.

Finally, `(finally-return 1 2 3)' is the same as
`(finally-return (list 1 2 3))'.  This is convenient when using
`seq-let', `pcase-let', `cl-destructuring-bind', and the like.

Any another argument is assumed to be a loop command.  For more
information, including a list of available loop commands, see the
Info node `(loopy)' distributed with this package."
