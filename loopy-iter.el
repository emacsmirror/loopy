;;; Commentary:
;; A macro similar to and heavily inspired by Common Lisp's Iterate package.
;; This package is somewhat like a translation of Iter into Loopy.
;;
;; To be able to arbitrarily nest structures, Loopy's constructs must be clearly
;; distinct from Lisp's other functions.
;;
;; Subject to change:
;; - loop commands start with `for': (for list i '(1 2 3))
;; - accumulation commands start with `accum': (accum collect i)
;; - early exit commands start with `exit': (exit return i)
;; - Special macro arguments should use unambiguous versions.  No aliases.
;;
;; See the `loopy' documentation for more details.

name collisions becoming more likely.")

This option is used only when the `lax-naming' flag is enabled.

For example, `loopy' provides a loop command `if', but in
`loopy-iter', one would probably prefer to use the special form
`if' provided by Emacs instead.

`loopy-iter' automatically checks whether an expression is a
function, macro, or special form before checking whether it is a
loop command, but this user option can be used to help avoid
errors when that fails."

By default, `loopy-iter' requires keywords to clearly distinguish

disabled with the `lax-naming' flag.

A loop command can be preceded by any of the keywords in this
list.  For example, by default, \"(for collect i)\" and
\"(accum collect i)\" are both valid way of identifying the
`collect' loop command."
